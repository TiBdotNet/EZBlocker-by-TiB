EZBlocker by TiB
=========

EZBlocker is a Spotify Ad Blocker written in C# for Windows 7/8/10. This project is a modified version of the Original EZBlocker written by Eric Zhang. The goal for EZBlocker is to be the most reliable ad blocker for Spotify.

When an advertisement is playing, EZBlocker will mute Spotify until it's over.
